# Phishing Simulation: NIN Verification Awareness

This is a cybersecurity phishing simulation project designed to raise awareness about the dangers of clicking unknown or suspicious links ‚Äî using Nigeria's National Identification Number (NIN) as the context.

##  Objective

To demonstrate how cybercriminals use **social engineering and fake login pages** to steal sensitive data, and to educate users on how to detect and avoid phishing attempts.

##  What I Did

- Crafted a **realistic phishing email** mimicking a Nigerian government NIN update request.
- Registered a **GitHub Pages-hosted fake NIN verification site**.
- Created a **login prompt** to simulate data entry and then reveal the simulation.
- Incorporated **delayed feedback** to simulate processing before showing an educational message.
- Embedded my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayodeji-aliu-97b880270/) to redirect visitors for portfolio visibility.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For educational purposes only. This project is intended strictly for **awareness training** and not for malicious use.

##  What I Learned

- How phishing attacks are structured using **psychological manipulation (social engineering)**.
- How to build and host phishing-like pages for training.
- The importance of verifying URLs before clicking.
- Web basics: HTML, GitHub Pages, and project deployment.

##  Responsible Disclosure

This project is purely educational and part of my journey into cybersecurity. I do not support or engage in any malicious activity. All simulations are clearly disclosed and non-functional in terms of storing real data.
