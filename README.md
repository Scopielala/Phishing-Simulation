## ‚ö†Ô∏è About the Simulation

The fake portal is crafted to look like a **NIMC verification login page**, prompting users to enter:

- Their NIN
- Date of Birth

After submitting, the simulation reveals that this was a **phishing attempt**, providing an educational warning on how easily such traps can be disguised.
